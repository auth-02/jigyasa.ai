# **Jigyasa**  
*Bridging Ancient Wisdom and Modern Accessibility*

---

## **Problem**  
Understanding spiritual texts like the *Bhagavad Gita* and *Patanjali Yoga Sutras* is challenging due to:  
- Complex language.  
- Contextual ambiguity.  
- Information overload.  

---

## **Solution**  
**Jigyasa** simplifies access to spiritual wisdom using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.  
It retrieves relevant shlokas and generates contextually accurate responses through advanced AI techniques and an intuitive interface.  

---

## **Key Features**  
### 🔍 **Web UI**  
- Built for seamless and intuitive user interaction.  

### 🛠 **RAG Pipeline**  
- Combines **semantic retrieval** with **structured knowledge retrieval**.  

### 📈 **LangSmith Integration**  
- Ensures traceability, transparency, and debugging support.  

### ✅ **Hallucination Mitigation**  
- Responses are backed by citations and confidence scoring for reliability.  

### 💡 **Cost Optimization**  
- Model quantization reduces costs and improves inference speed.  

### 🌍 **Scalability**  
- Designed to integrate new texts and support multilingual capabilities.  

---

## **Technical Highlights**  
### 🚀 **Retrieval**  
- Uses **Pinecone Vector DB** for efficient semantic search.  
- Reranks results using **BERT-based models** for relevance.  

### 🤖 **Response Generation**  
- Powered by **LLaMA 3.1**, with prompt engineering for accurate, citation-backed answers.  

### 🔍 **Traceability**  
- Integrated with **LangSmith** for tracking and debugging the RAG pipeline.
