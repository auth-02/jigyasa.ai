    "Introduction": "The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are in themselves exceedingly brief, less\nthan ten pages of large type in the original. Yet they contain the\nessence of practical wisdom, set forth in admirable order and detail.\nThe theme, if the present interpreter be right, is the great\nregeneration, the birth of the spiritual from the psychical man: the\nsame theme which Paul so wisely and eloquently set forth in writing to\nhis disciples in Corinth, the theme of all mystics in all lands.\n\nWe think of ourselves as living a purely physical life, in these\nmaterial bodies of ours. In reality, we have gone far indeed from pure\nphysical life; for ages, our life has been psychical, we have been\ncentred and immersed in the psychic nature. Some of the schools of\nIndia say that the psychic nature is, as it were, a looking-glass,\nwherein are mirrored the things seen by the physical eyes, and heard by\nthe physical ears. But this is a magic mirror; the images remain, and\ntake a certain life of their own. Thus within the psychic realm of our\nlife there grows up an imaged world wherein we dwell; a world of the\nimages of things seen and heard, and therefore a world of memories; a\nworld also of hopes and desires, of fears and regrets. Mental life\ngrows up among these images, built on a measuring and comparing, on the\nmassing of images together into general ideas; on the abstraction of\nnew notions and images from these; till a new world is built up within,\nfull of desires and hates, ambition, envy, longing, speculation,\ncuriosity, self-will, self-interest.\n\nThe teaching of the East is, that all these are true powers overlaid by\nfalse desires; that though in manifestation psychical, they are in\nessence spiritual; that the psychical man is the veil and prophecy of\nthe spiritual man.\n\nThe purpose of life, therefore, is the realizing of that prophecy; the\nunveiling of the immortal man; the birth of the spiritual from the\npsychical, whereby we enter our divine inheritance and come to inhabit\nEternity. This is, indeed, salvation, the purpose of all true religion,\nin all times.\n\nPatanjali has in mind the spiritual man, to be born from the psychical.\nHis purpose is, to set in order the practical means for the unveiling\nand regeneration, and to indicate the fruit, the glory and the power,\nof that new birth.\n\nThrough the Sutras of the first book, Patanjali is concerned with the\nfirst great problem, the emergence of the spiritual man from the veils\nand meshes of the psychic nature, the moods and vestures of the mental\nand emotional man. Later will come the consideration of the nature and\npowers of the spiritual man, once he stands clear of the psychic veils\nand trammels, and a view of the realms in which these new spiritual\npowers are to be revealed.\n\nAt this point may come a word of explanation. I have been asked why I\nuse the word Sutras, for these rules of Patanjali’s system, when the\nword Aphorism has been connected with them in our minds for a\ngeneration. The reason is this: the name Aphorism suggests, to me at\nleast, a pithy sentence of very general application; a piece of\nproverbial wisdom that may be quoted in a good many sets of\ncircumstance, and which will almost bear on its face the evidence of\nits truth. But with a Sutra the case is different. It comes from the\nsame root as the word “sew,” and means, indeed, a thread, suggesting,\ntherefore, a close knit, consecutive chain of argument. Not only has\neach Sutra a definite place in the system, but further, taken out of\nthis place, it will be almost meaningless, and will by no means be\nself-evident. So I have thought best to adhere to the original word.\nThe Sutras of Patanjali are as closely knit together, as dependent on\neach other, as the propositions of Euclid, and can no more be taken out\nof their proper setting.\n\nIn the second part of the first book, the problem of the emergence of\nthe spiritual man is further dealt with. We are led to the\nconsideration of the barriers to his emergence, of the overcoming of\nthe barriers, and of certain steps and stages in the ascent from the\nordinary consciousness of practical life, to the finer, deeper, radiant\nconsciousness of the spiritual man."

    "Introduction": "The first book of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras is called the Book of\nSpiritual Consciousness. The second book, which we now begin, is the\nBook of the Means of Soul Growth. And we must remember that soul growth\nhere means the growth of the realization of the spiritual man, or, to\nput the matter more briefly, the growth of the spiritual man, and the\ndisentangling of the spiritual man from the wrappings, the veils, the\ndisguises laid upon him by the mind and the psychical nature, wherein\nhe is enmeshed, like a bird caught in a net.\n\nThe question arises: By what means may the spiritual man be freed from\nthese psychical meshes and disguises, so that he may stand forth above\ndeath, in his radiant eternalness and divine power? And the second book\nsets itself to answer this very question, and to detail the means in a\nway entirely practical and very lucid, so that he who runs may read,\nand he who reads may understand and practise.\n\nThe second part of the second book is concerned with practical\nspiritual training, that is, with the earlier practical training of the\nspiritual man.\n\nThe most striking thing in it is the emphasis laid on the Commandments,\nwhich are precisely those of the latter part of the Decalogue, together\nwith obedience to the Master. Our day and generation is far too prone\nto fancy that there can be mystical life and growth on some other\nfoundation, on the foundation, for example, of intellectual curiosity\nor psychical selfishness. In reality, on this latter foundation the\nlife of the spiritual man can never be built; nor, indeed, anything but\na psychic counterfeit, a dangerous delusion.\n\nTherefore Patanjali, like every great spiritual teacher, meets the\nquestion: What must I do to be saved? with the age-old answer: Keep the\nCommandments. Only after the disciple can say, These have I kept, can\nthere be the further and finer teaching of the spiritual Rules.\n\nIt is, therefore, vital for us to realize that the Yoga system, like\nevery true system of spiritual teaching, rests on this broad and firm\nfoundation of honesty, truth, cleanness, obedience. Without these,\nthere is no salvation; and he who practices these, even though ignorant\nof spiritual things, is laying up treasure against the time to come."

    "Introduction": "The third book of the Sutras is the Book of Spiritual Powers. In\nconsidering these spiritual powers, two things must be understood and\nkept in memory. The first of these is this: These spiritual powers can\nonly be gained when the development described in the first and second\nbooks has been measurably attained; when the Commandments have been\nkept, the Rules faithfully followed, and the experiences which are\ndescribed have been passed through. For only after this is the\nspiritual man so far grown, so far disentangled from the psychical\nbandages and veils which have confined and blinded him, that he can use\nhis proper powers and faculties. For this is the secret of all\nspiritual powers: they are in no sense an abnormal or supernatural\novergrowth upon the material man, but are rather the powers and\nfaculties inherent in the spiritual man, entirely natural to him, and\ncoming naturally into activity, as the spiritual man is disentangled\nand liberated from psychical bondage, through keeping the Commandments\nand Rules already set forth.\n\nAs the personal man is the limitation and inversion of the spiritual\nman, all his faculties and powers are inversions of the powers of the\nspiritual man. In a single phrase, his self seeking is the inversion of\nthe Self-seeking which is the very being of the spiritual man: the\nceaseless search after the divine and august Self of all beings. This\ninversion is corrected by keeping the Commandments and Rules, and\ngradually, as the inversion is overcome, the spiritual man is\nextricated, and comes into possession and free exercise of his powers.\nThe spiritual powers, therefore, are the powers of the grown and\nliberated spiritual man. They can only be developed and used as the\nspiritual man grows and attains liberation through obedience. This is\nthe first thing to be kept in mind, in all that is said of spiritual\npowers in the third and fourth books of the Sutras. The second thing to\nbe understood and kept in mind is this:\n\nJust as our modern sages have discerned and taught that all matter is\nultimately one and eternal, definitely related throughout the whole\nwide universe; just as they have discerned and taught that all force is\none and eternal, so coordinated throughout the whole universe that\nwhatever affects any atom measurably affects the whole boundless realm\nof matter and force, to the most distant star or nebula on the dim\nconfines of space; so the ancient sages had discerned and taught that\nall consciousness is one, immortal, indivisible, infinite; so finely\ncorrelated and continuous that whatever is perceived by any\nconsciousness is, whether actually or potentially, within the reach of\nall consciousness, and therefore within the reach of any consciousness.\nThis has been well expressed by saying that all souls are fundamentally\none with the Oversoul; that the Son of God, and all Sons of God, are\nfundamentally one with the Father. When the consciousness is cleared of\npsychic bonds and veils, when the spiritual man is able to stand, to\nsee, then this superb law comes into effect: whatever is within the\nknowledge of any consciousness, and this includes the whole infinite\nuniverse, is within his reach, and may, if he wills, be made a part of\nhis consciousness. This he may attain through his fundamental unity\nwith the Oversoul, by raising himself toward the consciousness above\nhim, and drawing on its resources. The Son, if he would work miracles,\nwhether of perception or of action, must come often into the presence\nof the Father. This is the birthright of the spiritual man; through it\nhe comes into possession of his splendid and immortal powers. Let it be\nclearly kept in mind that what is here to be related of the spiritual\nman, and his exalted powers, must in no wise be detached from what has\ngone before. The being, the very inception, of the spiritual man\ndepends on the purification and moral attainment already detailed, and\ncan in no wise dispense with these or curtail them.\n\nLet no one imagine that the true life, the true powers of the spiritual\nman, can be attained by any way except the hard way of sacrifice, of\ntrial, of renunciation, of selfless self-conquest and genuine devotion\nto the weal of all others. Only thus can the golden gates be reached\nand entered. Only thus can we attain to that pure world wherein the\nspiritual man lives, and moves, and has his being. Nothing impure,\nnothing unholy can ever cross that threshold, least of all impure\nmotives or self seeking desires. These must be burnt away before an\nentrance to that world can be gained.\n\nBut where there is light, there is shadow; and the lofty light of the\nsoul casts upon the clouds of the mid-world the shadow of the spiritual\nman and of his powers; the bastard vesture and the bastard powers of\npsychism are easily attained; yet, even when attained, they are a\ndelusion, the very essence of unreality.\n\nTherefore ponder well the earlier rules, and lay a firm foundation of\ncourage, sacrifice, selflessness, holiness."

    "Chapter Number": 4,
    "Introduction": "The third book of the Sutras has fairly completed the history of the\nbirth and growth of the spiritual man, and the enumeration of his\npowers; at least so far as concerns that first epoch in his immortal\nlife, which immediately succeeds, and supersedes, the life of the\nnatural man.\n\nIn the fourth book, we are to consider what one might call the\nmechanism of salvation, the ideally simple working of cosmic law which\nbrings the spiritual man to birth, growth, and fulness of power, and\nprepares him for the splendid, toilsome further stages of his great\njourney home.\n\nThe Sutras are here brief to obscurity; only a few words, for example,\nare given to the great triune mystery and illusion of Time; a phrase or\ntwo indicates the sweep of some universal law. Yet it is hoped that, by\nkeeping our eyes fixed on the spiritual man, remembering that he is the\nhero of the story, and that all that is written concerns him and his\nadventures, we may be able to find our way through this thicket of\ntangled words, and keep in our hands the clue to the mystery.\n\nThe last part of the last book needs little introduction. In a sense,\nit is the most important part of the whole treatise, since it unmasks\nthe nature of the personality, that psychical “mind,” which is the\nwakeful enemy of all who seek to tread the path. Even now, we can hear\nit whispering the doubt whether that can be a good path, which thus\nsets “mind” at defiance.\n\nIf this, then, be the most vital and fundamental part of the teaching,\nshould it not stand at the very beginning? It may seem so at first; but\nhad it stood there, we should not have comprehended it. For he who\nwould know the doctrine must lead the life, doing the will of his\nFather which is in Heaven."
